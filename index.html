&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of
objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in
 machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems applying technology by taking an
 input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.

&nbsp;The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later
 Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their
environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical
 barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.

&nbsp;Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many
 technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of
 Earth's environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology.
 Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.</p>
